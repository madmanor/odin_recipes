     <h2>How to Make The Best Steak Fajitas</h2>
     
     <h3>Ingredients</h3>
     <ul>
          <p>The Best Fajitas</p>
          <li>1 pound skirt/flank steak</li>
          <li>1 tablespoon oil</li>
          <li>2 diced white onions</li>
          <li>2-3 peppers of choice, sliced</li>
          
          <p>The Best Marinade</p>
          <li>1/3 cup lime juice</li>
          <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
          <li>2 teaspoon ground cumin & chili powder</li>
          <li>1/4 cup chopped cilantro</li>
          <li>3 teaspoons olive oil</li>
          
          <p>Any of Your Favorite Toppings</p>
          <li>corn or flour tortillas</li>
          <li>shredded cheese</li>
          <li>spanish rice</li>
     </ul>
     
     <h3>Steps</h3>
     <ol>
          <li>STEAK MARINADE: Combine the ingredients for the marinade in a large shallow bowl or zip-top bag. Give it a taste to check for seasonings and adjust to preference. Coat the steak with the marinade and let sit covered in the refrigerator for at least 2-4 hours and ideally overnight (or see notes to freeze.) Remove from the refrigerator 30 minutes prior to grilling.</li>
          <li>COOK: Set a large cast iron skillet or grill pan over high heat and let heat up for a couple of minutes. Add the steak to the pan and fry on each side for about 3-5 minutes or longer if you'd like it more done. Feel for desired firmness. The 3 minutes/side will yield a medium rare doneness. If the pan becomes too hot, reduce the heat to medium-high. Remove the steak from the pan and allow it to rest for several minutes, tented with a piece of foil.</li>
          <li>FAJITA VEGGIES: Add the remaining tablespoon of oil to the pan over high heat, and add in the onions, poblano, and bell peppers. Let the veggies begin to sizzle and toss as necessary, cook for a total of 2-3 minutes or longer if you prefer them softer, season with a pinch of salt and pepper. If your pan is small, cook the veggies in a few batches so they don't steam. </li>
          <li>SLICE: Slice the meat against the grain into thin slices. I like to do so on an angle so the meat slices are tender and thin. Add it back to the veggies if you'd like.</li>
          <li>ASSEMBLE: Serve fajitas in tortillas or on rice bowls topped with your favorite toppings!</li>
     </ol>
